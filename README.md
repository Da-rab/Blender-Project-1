# Blender-Project-1
In this project, I take my first steps into the 3D modelling software known as blender and learn the basics.

# sesssions
## session #1
Here I created the man for my scene, I also textured to man using principled BSDF, and a spot light to simulate his torch. I also used an emission texture to give a glow to his flashlight. I am bit slow right now but with practice I should get faster.

## session #2
Here I modelled the monster for my scene, making use of the mirror modifier and edit tool. I also used an emission texture to give a red glow to the monster's eyes.

## session #3
Since I was not satisfied with the design of the monster and noticed that it was not actually looking at the man, I decided to redo it in a more refined fashion. I also angled the man's torch upwards twards the monster's head.
